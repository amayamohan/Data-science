
 Linear Regression



Step 1: Collect Data

Ravi checked some houses in his town:

600 sqft → $180,000

1000 sqft → $270,000

1400 sqft → $350,000

1800 sqft → $430,000

He wrote them down


Step 2: Find the Pattern

Ravi saw:

Small houses = cheaper

Big houses = more costly

But the prices grow in a straight-line pattern.


Step 3: Draw the Line

His teacher said:
“Use Linear Regression. It will draw the best line through your data points.”

Price=m×Size+c


Step 4: Make a Prediction

Ravi’s friend asked:
“What about a 1250 sqft house?”

Ravi looked at the line. It showed about $320,000.

Even though 1250 sqft was not in his list, the line helped him guess the price.


Step 5: Lesson

Ravi explained:

Collect real data (blue dots).

Draw the best line (red line).

Use the line to predict new values.
